    "desc1": "A hare was making fun of a tortoise for being so slow. 'Though you are very slow,' he said, 'I will run a race with you any day you like.' The tortoise agreed to run a race. When the day came, both started together. The hare ran very fast for some time, and then stopped to rest. He felt sure that he could beat the tortoise easily. The tortoise walked on slowly but steadily. After a while, the hare awoke from his nap and looked for the tortoise. To his surprise, the tortoise was near the winning post. The hare ran as fast as he could, but it was too late. The tortoise had already won the race. -test-",
